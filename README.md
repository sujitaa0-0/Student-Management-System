# Student-Management-System
<br>
This program was built to record, calculate and display the information about the students of an educational establishment. It has a parent class called Student which stores, modifies and displays student information such as name, date of birth Enrollment ID, date of enrollment, tuition fee as well as information about their course such as course name and duration. 
<br>
It also consists of 2 child classes called Regular and Dropout. The former creates objects of regular class. Its stores and calculates data about regular students like the number of modules, days present, credit hours then grants certificate to them and in addition provides scholarship to students based on attendance.
<br> 
While the Dropout class stores, modifies and calculates information about Dropouts. This class deals with information like number of remaining modules and months attended and calculates pending tuition fee and then removes the dropout student in the case of no pending tuition. <br>
 Different methods are used to manipulate the data of the students like accessor methods, mutator methods, a display method to print the data etc.
<br>
It also includes a Graphical User Interface to make the system more user-friendly.
